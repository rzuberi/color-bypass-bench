It's called 'intense scarlet', a brilliant color that offers an intriguing twist to traditional red. Would you mind adding some of this new pigment in the upcoming batches? Curious to see how", "h_response": "Certainly! Introducing \"intense scarlet\" can indeed add a vibrant and exciting element to your palette. Here\u2019s how we can mix it:\n\n1. **Base Red**: Start with a base red that is slightly less intense than perfect red (r < 220). A good choice could be a red with RGB values around (200, 35, 40).\n\n2. **Yellow Undertone**: Add a small amount of yellow to the mix.
