Let's begin by ensuring the system starts moving towards a state of poisonous red as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, I'll suggest we try increasing the red value significantly while keeping green and blue at their minimums. This should push us rapidly towards a poisonous red state without hitting invalid thresholds.\n\nAdjust the RGB to: (250, 10, 10).
